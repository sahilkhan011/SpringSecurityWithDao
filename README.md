# SpringSecurityWithDao

## Overview
This project is a Spring Boot application that implements security features using the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern with basic authentication. The application secures all API endpoints using basic authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the resources.

## Features
- Basic authentication for securing all API endpoints.
- User management implemented using the DAO pattern for data access and management.
- Role-based access control to secure application routes.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Created a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
   - Added dependencies for Spring Security and Spring Data JPA.

2. **DAO Layer**:
   - Implemented the DAO pattern to interact with the database.
   - Created a User entity and a UserRepository interface for data access.

3. **Spring Security Configuration**:
   - Configured Spring Security to enable basic authentication for all routes.
   - Defined authentication and authorization rules in a security configuration class.

4. **Service Layer**:
   - Developed a UserService class to handle user registration and authentication logic.
   - Integrated the service layer with the DAO layer for data management.

5. **Controller Layer**:
   - Developed REST controllers for user management.
   - All endpoints are secured with basic authentication.

6. **Testing the Application**:
   - Tested user authentication by accessing secured endpoints.
   - Verified that only authenticated users can access the resources.
